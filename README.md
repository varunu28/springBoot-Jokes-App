# springBoot-Jokes-App
A Spring Boot web application which displays a random Chuck Norris joke on the index.


### What does the app do?
Once the JokesappApplication class runs you can see a Chuck Norris joke. You get a new one everytime the page is refreshed.

My favorite one is:

**"Code runs fast when Chuck Norris runs it"**

### How to run it?

Just download it by using the below command and run the JokesappApplication


`git clone https://github.com/varunu28/springBoot-Jokes-App.git`

Make sure you have maven installed
